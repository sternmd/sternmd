                 Using Google Sheets concatenation, I created a large array of objects with key-value pairs for each author and over 300 total quotes. Then with the power of <strong>Javascript</strong> & <strong>jQuery</strong>, an on click function would pull a quote based on a predefined author variable and insert it into a div ID. If no author variable was defined, the function would simply loop through the array to display a random quote. Overall, the most challenging part was figuring out the JS functionality and setting  CSS media queries.

							<h3>Nimbus Prints</h3>

              <p>
                Nimbus Prints is a DIYnamic screenprinting boutique in Chicago. Our fan-based t-shirt designs are inspired by anime, manga, otaku culture, music, film, & more!
              </p>

              <p class="hide">
                I first learned about screenprinting in a middle school art class in 2005. It was only a week long project but a friend and I decided to continue this DIY hobby outside of the classroom and never really stopped. At the time, we dug skateboarding, street art, cult movies, and rock music. So we saved up enough money to buy screening kits, cutting boards, and x-acto knives to put our ideas into action. Many mistakes later, we were able to print everything we fancied from Hendrix to Dali to Kerouac to Tarantino. Soon our friends wanted t-shirts for themselves...
              <p>

              <p class="hide">
                Fast forward several years and this middle school hobby grew out of my parents' basement, into a makeshift college dorm room, and is now an independent art studio in Chicago known as Nimbus Prints.
